# SchoolManager
A web application allows you to manage your school
An Web application  in ASP.NET coded in C # connected to a SQL Server database allows the  management of the schooling. This application was developed for the end of studies project following a request of one of my teachers for the benefit of A private primary school. This application allows:
* Administration: manage pupils, classes, teachers, absences, payments, manage events, contact parents ...
* Teachers: manage students's exams scores, contact parents and administration ...
* Parents: checking scores, absences of children, interacting with events (booking), settling payments and services of their children, direct contact with teachers, administration ...
